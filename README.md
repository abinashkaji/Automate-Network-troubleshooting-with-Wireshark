Collect and analyze network latency, packet loss, and round-trip time (RTT) data.
Real-time Monitoring:

### Continuously monitor network connectivity in real-time.
Display live statistics, such as response times and packet loss percentages.
Troubleshooting Assistance:

### Identify potential network issues based on ping results.
Provide diagnostic information to aid in troubleshooting.
User-Friendly Interface:

### Intuitive command-line interface for ease of use.
Clear and concise output to assist users in interpreting results.

### Customization:
Adjustable parameters for ping operations, allowing users to tailor tests to specific requirements.
