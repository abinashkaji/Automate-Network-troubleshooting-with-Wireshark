# Data Learn Courses

Welcome to Data Learn Courses! Here, we offer a range of courses to equip you with essential skills and knowledge in the fields of Analytics, Data Science, and SQL. Our courses are designed to cater to different experience levels, from beginners to advanced learners. Let's take a closer look at what we have to offer:

## Getting Started with Analytics (Data) Engineering

In this course, I, as a seasoned data engineer with over 10 years of experience in creating analytical solutions in various countries, will guide you through the fundamentals of Analytics Engineering. We will cover Business Intelligence tools, databases, ETL tools, cloud computing, and more. Whether you are completely new to the field of data or have some experience, this course is designed to benefit everyone.

The initial modules will focus on the basics of analytics and classic tasks such as Business Intelligence, reporting, visualization, data warehousing, SQL, and Excel. This knowledge will be sufficient for roles like BI Developer, Analyst, and more. As we progress to module 5-6, we will dive into the work of a Data Engineer, building upon the foundational knowledge.

## Getting Started with Machine Learning and Data Science (ML-101)

Led by Anastasia Rizzo, this course offers a comprehensive exploration of the theory of Machine Learning and Data Science, accompanied by practical real-life cases. The course is divided into three modules. Module 1 covers the theory of machine learning and data science, Module 2 delves into Regression (theory and practice), and Module 3 explores Classification with two practical cases. Whether you are a bit hesitant but keen on starting your journey into this exciting field, this course is perfect for you.

## SQL for Beginners (SQL-101)

Taught by Anatoly Balakirev, this course introduces you to working with databases using the Structured Query Language (SQL). The course comprises three modules, each containing ten video lessons. Ideal for those with no prior experience in database work, the course progresses from simple to complex concepts. Each lesson is accompanied by examples and files to facilitate learning.

Note: The SQL course perfectly complements Module 2 of the Engineering and Analytics course.

## Analytical Community for Women

At Data Learn, we recognize the need for a supportive community for women interested in analytics and technology. We aim to create a space where women can comfortably learn and grow at their own pace. We encourage interested individuals to join us in developing this community, and we are committed to assisting with content creation and organizing webinars with international speakers. This community can also serve as a valuable resource for finding job opportunities and potential employees.
